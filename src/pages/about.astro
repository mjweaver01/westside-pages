              Westside Barbell is an invitation only training laboratory where only the
              strongest of mind and body survive. Our goal is simple. To become the best and
              push every boundary known to man in doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lineage and achievements of all Westside Barbell athletes who have walked
              through our chalky doors is of legends. Our gym has broke over 140 world
              records, won olympic gold, heavyweight world championships, to name but a few
              of our achievements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our education is based on theoretical research and is backed by practical
              application. We only write about what works, not what might work or what
              doesn't work. We believe that training information should filter down from the
              athletes at the the top rather than spew out from the keyboard hero's at the
              bottom.
