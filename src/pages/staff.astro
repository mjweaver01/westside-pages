              </h1>
              <h4>Founder of Westside Barbell</h4>
              <p>
                Louie Simmons was a world-renowned Strength/Special Strengths coach and the founder
                of Westside Barbell. He was in the gym every day watching and analyzing all athletic
                training from all his powerlifters to track and field. Westside Barbell was a living
                laboratory for Louie where he conducted constant athletic experiments to push the
                boundaries of what is possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Louie coached 24 athletes who deadlift over 800 pounds and three who deadlift over
                900lbs, fifteen members who have a total lifting record over 2500 pounds and seven
                over 2600 pound total. Westside Barbell is the only gym in the world to have two
                over 2700 pound totals, plus five over 2800 pounds and one who has the biggest total
                of all time with 3005lbs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Louie published over 300 training articles, authored eight books, and produced ten
                highly respected training videos. Louie Simmons also the invented the Reverse
                HyperÂ® machine, Inverse Curl machine, Hip/Quad machine, Static/Dynamic developer
                and the Virtual Force Swing.
              </p>
              <p>
                He was a strength consultant for the Cleveland Browns, Green Bay Packers, Seattle
                Seahawks, and numerous college football teams. Louie worked closely with Kent
                Johnson, Johnny Parker, and Buddy Morris and a host of other professional and
                top-level strength coaches. Additionally, he trained 2 Olympic gold medal sprinters,
                Butch Reynolds and Moe Robinson, both 400-meter sprinters.
              </p>
              <p>
                On his passing, Louie's wife Doris Simmons took over sole ownership of Westside
